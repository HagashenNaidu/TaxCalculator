# TaxCalculator

Tax Calculator built with ASP.Net Core 2.2 using a localdb as the datastore.

EF is used as the ORM and to setup the Database using migrations.

Used the built-in ASP.Net Core IoC container.

Nunit Core for tests.

Utilisation of the Strategy Pattern for the various types of Tax Calculators

UI is done using Razor (not a work of art as I am not a UI person)
